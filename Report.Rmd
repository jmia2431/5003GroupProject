# Define the Problem
What is the research question your group wants to investigate?
Describe how this is a classification problem
Why does it matter, and how does it connect to Sydney/Australia (applicable if you solve a local problem)?

The research question for this project is:  
What kinds of Airbnb lisiting are more likely to be available year-round versus those that are occasional or long-term rentals
